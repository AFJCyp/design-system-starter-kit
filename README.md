Rapid prototyping environment using the [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/).

## Quick Start

Prerequisites: a stable version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. `git clone git@github.com:salesforce-ux/design-system-starter-kit.git && cd design-system-starter-kit`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Open <http://localhost:3000>

That's it! Edit the `app/index.html` file and build awesome prototypes.

## What's inside?

- SLDS Components and CSS, imported using [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com/)
- [SVG4Everybody](https://github.com/jonathantneal/svg4everybody), a polyfill that helps browsers display SVG icons
- [Live reload using BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/): automatic browser reloading on file changes, and cross-device testing
- Sourcemaps support ([for live in-browser Sass development](https://medium.com/@toolmantim/getting-started-with-css-sourcemaps-and-in-browser-sass-editing-b4daab987fb0))
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) (adds vendor prefixes to CSS rules)
