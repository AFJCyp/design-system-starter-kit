# Views

This is where all of your pages and templates live.

## Nunjucks

The starter kit uses a powerful (but optional) templating engine:
[Nunjucks](http://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

The syntax is very close to traditional HTML, allowing designers and
developers alike to get comfortable with the code really quickly.

## Templates

A default template is provided in [`_template.html`](_template.html).

## Views

Views are HTML or Nunjucks files, e.g. `index.html`, `filename.html`.

Add as many as needed, and link between them like you would with classic HTML.
